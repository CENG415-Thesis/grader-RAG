        "expected_answer": "QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, and 256QAM are used for downlink; pi/2 BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM are used for uplink.",
        "llm_answer": "Response: According to the given context, the modulation schemes supported by the LTE physical layer are:\n\n* \u03c0/2 BPSK\n* \u03c0/4 QPSK\n* QPSK\n* 16QAM\n* 64QAM\n* 256QAM\n\nThese modulation techniques are used in the uplink of LTE, depending on the type of operation.\nSources: ['data/lte_related.pdf:11:7', 'data/lte_related.pdf:10:11', 'data/lte_related.pdf:8:2', 'data/lte_related.pdf:7:13', 'data/lte_related.pdf:10:4']",
        "grading_result": "Here are my evaluations:\n\n**Groundedness:** 0.9\nThe response is mostly grounded, as it accurately lists the modulation techniques mentioned in the context. However, the context only mentions specific modulation schemes used for uplink (pi/2 BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM) and downlink (QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, and 256QAM), but not all of them are mentioned in the response. Additionally, some modulation schemes like \u03c0/4 QPSK are not present in the context.\n\n**Answer Relevance:** 0.8\nThe response is mostly relevant to the question, as it lists the modulation techniques used in the physical layer of LTE. However, some answers (\u03c0/4 QPSK) are not supported by the context and may be considered non-relevant.\n\n**Context Relevance:** 0.5\nSome parts of the response are correct based on the context, such as the mention of pi/2 BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM for uplink. However, some answers like \u03c0/4 QPSK, 256QAM for downlink, and mentioning modulation schemes for both uplink and downlink are not supported by the context.\n\nOverall, I would give a score of:\n\nGroundedness: 0.9\nAnswer Relevance: 0.8\nContext Relevance: 0.5\n\nAverage Score: 0.74"

        "question": "Why is cell search necessary in LTE?",
        "expected_answer": "It is required for the User Equipment (UE) to achieve frequency and time synchronization before connecting to a cell.",
        "llm_answer": "Response: According to the provided context, cell search is a physical layer procedure involved with LTE operation. It is also mentioned as one part of synchronisation procedures, along with timing synchronisation. Therefore, it can be inferred that cell search is necessary in LTE for synchronization purposes, likely to enable devices to find and connect to a specific cellular network (cell).\nSources: ['data/lte_related.pdf:10:11', 'data/lte_related.pdf:12:6', 'data/lte_related.pdf:10:6', 'data/lte_related.pdf:8:2', 'data/lte_related.pdf:5:2']",
        "grading_result": "Here are my evaluations:\n\n**Groundedness:** 0.9\nThe response is grounded in the provided context, specifically mentioning \"the provided context\" and referencing specific lines of the PDF file as sources. While it would be even more effective to directly quote the relevant text from the context, the response does a good job of using the context to support its argument.\n\n**Answer Relevance:** 1.0\nThe response directly answers the question about why cell search is necessary in LTE. It provides a clear explanation that cell search is required for synchronization purposes, which is exactly what the question asked.\n\n**Context Relevance:** 1.0\nThe response is actually correct based on the provided context. The context does mention that frequency and time synchronization are required before connecting to a cell, and the response correctly identifies cell search as one part of those synchronization procedures.\n\nOverall score: 0.95"

        "question": "What is the difference between FDD and TDD modes?",
        "expected_answer": "FDD uses separate frequency bands for downlink and uplink, while TDD uses the same frequency band with time-division access.",
        "llm_answer": "Response: According to the provided context, the main difference between Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) modes is the way they handle duplex operation:\n\n* FDD supports both full duplex and half duplex operations.\n* TDD only applies to Radio Frame Structure Type 2, which consists of two half-frames with a duration of 5ms each.\n\nIn other words, FDD allows for simultaneous transmission and reception on different frequencies, while TDD separates transmission and reception into different time slots.\nSources: ['data/lte_related.pdf:8:5', 'data/lte_related.pdf:8:16', 'data/lte_related.pdf:8:21', 'data/lte_related.pdf:15:10', 'data/lte_related.pdf:15:19']",
        "grading_result": "Here are my evaluations:\n\n**Groundedness: 0.8**\nThe response does address the question, but it doesn't fully provide a comprehensive answer. While it correctly highlights the frequency band difference between FDD and TDD modes, it also provides some additional information about FDD supporting both full duplex and half duplex operations, which is not directly related to the question.\n\n**Answer Relevance: 1**\nThe response is highly relevant to the question, providing a clear explanation of the key differences between FDD and TDD modes.\n\n**Context Relevance: 0.9**\nThe response is mostly correct based on the provided context. The only slight issue is that it mentions \"Radio Frame Structure Type 2\" which is not directly related to the original context about frequency bands. However, this minor inaccuracy does not significantly impact the overall relevance of the answer.\n\nOverall score: 0.85"
